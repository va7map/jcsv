# Install jCSV #

All you need to do is to include the latest version of jCSV to your classpath.
The latest stable version is 1.0.1 and can be downloaded in the [download area](http://code.google.com/p/jcsv/downloads/list).

If you want to use some of the new features, you can use the SNAPSHOT version. It will do its work, but the API may change until it becomes stable.

Download (stable): [jcsv-1.4.0.jar](http://code.google.com/p/jcsv/downloads/detail?name=jcsv-1.4.0.jar&can=2&q=)
