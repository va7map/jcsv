jCSV is a fast and very easy to use csv library for Java. With just a few lines of Code you can parse any csv file.
jCSV also provides mechanisms to bind the csv file directly to java objects. See the Wiki for some working examples.

jCSV fully supports the csv standard that is described in: [Comma-separated values - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

More features:
  * entry filter, see [here](CSVEntryFilter.md)
  * fully configurable format, see [here](CSVStrategy.md)
  * cached csv reader, see [here](CachedReader.md)
  * write csv files, see [here](CSVWriter.md)
